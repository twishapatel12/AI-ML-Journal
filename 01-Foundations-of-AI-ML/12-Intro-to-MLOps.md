# Introduction to MLOps

---

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) is the set of practices that help you take a machine learning model from a Jupyter notebook or script to a real product used by thousands—or even millions—of people.  
It blends the best of machine learning, DevOps, and software engineering so that models are reliable, scalable, and easy to improve over time.

---

## Why Do We Need MLOps?

- **ML isn’t just about building a model:** It’s about making sure that model stays accurate, up-to-date, and robust even as your data, users, and business goals change.
- **Manual processes break at scale:** You can’t retrain or deploy models by hand if your team, data, or product is growing.
- **ML is teamwork:** Data scientists, ML engineers, DevOps, and software teams must all collaborate—and MLOps is the glue that holds it together.

## The MLOps Lifecycle (Step by Step)

Let’s see how MLOps works in the real world with visuals:

### 1. Simplified MLOps Pipeline

This diagram shows the key steps of an MLOps pipeline:
- **Data Engineering:** Ingest, clean, and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Engineering:** Train and validate models using best practices and tracked experiments.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Automatically test and push new models or code to production, just like in software engineering.
- **Model Registry:** Store and manage all versions of models in a central place.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track the quality and behavior of models in production.
- **Prediction Service:** Serve predictions to users or applications in real-time or batch.

### 2. CI/CD and ML Pipeline Automation

Here you can see how MLOps brings together code, data, and infrastructure:
- **Version Control (Git):** All code, including pipelines and configuration, is tracked for reproducibility.
- **Automated Pipelines:** Data flows through preparation, training, evaluation, and deployment without manual steps.
- **CI/CD:** Any change (to code, data, or model) can trigger automatic testing and deployment, reducing manual work and risk.

### 3. MLOps with Feature Store and Pipeline

A **feature store** is a special database for storing, reusing, and serving input features to models:
- **Data Ingestion:** Raw data is converted into features for model training and predictions.
- **Feature Store:** Enables consistent feature engineering for both training and production.
- **Model Training & Validation:** Models are trained and tested using these features.
- **Deployment:** Validated models are deployed to production systems.
- **Monitoring:** System tracks feature and model performance, alerting when retraining is needed.

### 4. End-to-End MLOps Architecture

This architecture shows the full journey:
- **Data Sources:** Multiple raw data sources (databases, sensors, logs, etc.)
- **Experimentation:** Data scientists run many experiments and log results.
- **Model Registry & Versioning:** Every model and dataset version is tracked.
- **Deployment:** Production systems fetch models from registry for serving.
- **Monitoring & Feedback:** Models are monitored for performance, and feedback/data drift triggers retraining.

---

## What Are the Main Parts of an MLOps Workflow?

1. **Version Control**: Use Git (for code), DVC (for data/model versioning).
2. **Data Pipeline**: Automate data cleaning, feature engineering, and validation.
3. **Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts (MLflow, Weights & Biases).
4. **Model Registry**: Central place to store models and their metadata.
5. **Deployment**: Package and serve models (Docker, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, etc).
6. **Monitoring**: Watch for model drift, data changes, and production errors.
7. **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated retraining, testing, and deployment of new models.

## Real-World Example: Serving a Model with FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

@app.get("/predict")
def predict(size: float, rooms: int):
    features = np.array([[size, rooms]])
    price = model.predict(features)
    return {"predicted_price": float(price[0])}
````

This example shows how to wrap a trained model as a REST API endpoint.
With MLOps, you’d automate its testing, deployment, and monitoring!

## Best Practices for MLOps

* Automate everything you can—pipelines, testing, deployment, monitoring.
* Track code, data, and model versions together for full reproducibility.
* Use containers for repeatable environments.
* Monitor models in production for data drift and errors.
* Communicate and collaborate across teams (data, engineering, ops).
