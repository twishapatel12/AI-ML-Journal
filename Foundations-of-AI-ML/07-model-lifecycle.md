# Model Lifecycle

---

## Introduction

Building a machine learning model is not just about writing code or training once. Each model goes through a series of steps called the **model lifecycle**—from understanding the problem and collecting data to deploying the model and maintaining it in the real world. Knowing this lifecycle helps you build better, more reliable, and more useful ML systems.

## The Stages of the Model Lifecycle

Here are the major steps in any ML model’s journey:

1. **Problem Definition**
2. **Data Collection**
3. **Data Preparation (Cleaning & Feature Engineering)**
4. **Model Selection**
5. **Model Training**
6. **Model Evaluation**
7. **Model Deployment**
8. **Model Monitoring & Maintenance**

## Step 1: Problem Definition

Start with a clear question:
- Are you predicting a number (regression) or a category (classification)?
- What will success look like for the model?

**Example:**  
Predicting house prices (regression) or classifying emails as spam or not (classification).

---

## Step 2: Data Collection

Gather the data you need to solve the problem.
- This can come from databases, APIs, surveys, sensors, or manual collection.

**Example:**  
A CSV file with features like number of rooms, location, and price for house prediction.

---

## Step 3: Data Preparation

Prepare data so the model can learn from it.
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Encode categories as numbers.
- Scale numerical values.

**Code Example:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

df = pd.read_csv('houses.csv')
df['location'] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df['location'])
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['size', 'price']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['size', 'price']])
````

---

## Step 4: Model Selection

Choose the right algorithm based on the problem and data.

* Use regression models for numbers, classification models for categories.
* Try multiple algorithms to see what works best.

**Example:**
Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks for predicting prices.

---

## Step 5: Model Training

Feed the training data to the chosen model so it can learn.

**Code Example:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = df[['size', 'location']]
y = df['price']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
```

---

## Step 6: Model Evaluation

Check how well the model works on **new, unseen data**.

* Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.

**Example:**
Split the data into training and test sets, and measure performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
```

---

## Step 7: Model Deployment

Deploy the model so others can use it (on a website, app, or API).

* Common tools: Flask/FastAPI (Python web frameworks), cloud platforms.

</p>

---

## Step 8: Monitoring & Maintenance

Even after deployment, monitor model performance:

* Does the model’s accuracy drop over time? (due to new trends or data drift)
* Collect new data and retrain if needed.
* Fix bugs and respond to user feedback.

**Summary:**
The ML model lifecycle is an ongoing loop—models are never “done.” Regular updates, evaluation, and improvements are critical for success in real-world ML projects.
