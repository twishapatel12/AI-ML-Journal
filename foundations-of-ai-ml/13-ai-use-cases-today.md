# AI Use Cases Today

---

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a research buzzword—it powers countless applications you use every day.  
This guide explores where AI is actually used, the technology behind it, and why it matters.

## How AI is Used in the Real World

AI is everywhere: in your phone, your bank, your workplace, and even your favorite websites.  
Let’s look at some major areas where AI is making a real impact:

---

## 1. Healthcare

- **Medical Imaging:** AI analyzes X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to detect diseases earlier and more accurately than ever before.
- **Drug Discovery:** AI models simulate how molecules might interact, speeding up the search for new medicines.
- **Patient Monitoring:** Wearables and hospital systems use AI to spot risks and predict problems.

**Code Example: Predicting Disease Risk with Logistic Regression**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

X = [[65, 1], [45, 0], [56, 1], [33, 0]]  # [age, smoker]
y = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 = has disease, 0 = healthy

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
print("Prediction for 50yo smoker:", model.predict([[50, 1]]))
````

## 2. Finance

* **Fraud Detection:** AI spots unusual transactions in real-time and blocks potential fraud automatically.
* **Credit Scoring:** Banks use AI to analyze more data, making fairer loan decisions.
* **Algorithmic Trading:** AI systems buy and sell stocks in milliseconds, reacting to news and trends.

*AI in banking and finance: fraud prevention, credit assessment, robo-advisors, trading bots.*

---

## 3. Transportation

* **Self-Driving Cars:** Cameras and sensors feed data to AI, which makes split-second driving decisions.
* **Traffic Prediction:** Google Maps uses AI to predict travel times and suggest the best routes.
* **Logistics Optimization:** Delivery companies use AI to schedule shipments and optimize routes.

## 4. Retail & E-Commerce

* **Recommendation Engines:** Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube suggest products and shows using AI.
* **Inventory & Supply Chain:** AI predicts what will sell, helping stores avoid running out of stock or over-ordering.
* **Chatbots & Customer Service:** AI-powered bots answer customer questions instantly.

**Code Example: Product Recommendation (Conceptual)**

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

X = [[5, 100], [3, 80], [4, 90], [2, 75]]  # [user rating, product price]
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
model.fit(X)
print("Best match for user [4, 95]:", model.kneighbors([[4, 95]])[1])
```

*Personalized recommendations, smart inventory, and AI chatbots.*

---

## 5. Everyday Life & Entertainment

* **Voice Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant recognize speech and answer questions.
* **Image Recognition:** Facebook and Google Photos tag friends and objects automatically.
* **Content Creation:** AI generates art, writes music, and even creates short stories.

---

### Visual: AI in Everyday Life

*Speech assistants, smart cameras, auto-captioning, spam filters, social media feeds.*

---

## Why AI Use Cases Are Growing

* More data than ever before (from phones, sensors, apps, and the web)
* Cheaper, more powerful computers (cloud computing, GPUs)
* Open-source tools and libraries available for everyone
* Demand for automation, personalization, and faster decisions in every industry
