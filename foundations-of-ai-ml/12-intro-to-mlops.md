# Introduction to MLOps

---

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) is a set of practices and tools for deploying, managing, and maintaining machine learning models in real-world environments.  
It brings together the best practices from **machine learning**, **software engineering**, and **DevOps** (development + operations).

**Why is MLOps important?**  
Building a good ML model is just the startâ€”real business impact comes from putting that model into production, monitoring it, and updating it as data and requirements change.

---

## What Problems Does MLOps Solve?

- Moving models from research (Jupyter notebooks) to real applications (websites, mobile apps, APIs)
- Keeping track of different model versions and experiments
- Automating data pipelines and retraining
- Monitoring models for accuracy, bias, and drift
- Collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and business teams

## Key Components of MLOps

1. **Version Control:**  
   Track code, data, and model changes (like using Git for code).

2. **Automated Data Pipelines:**  
   Automate data cleaning, transformation, and validation.

3. **Model Training and Experiment Tracking:**  
   Keep records of experiments, parameters, and results (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases).

4. **Model Deployment:**  
   Serve models as APIs or within applications, so others can use them.

5. **Model Monitoring:**  
   Track model performance, data drift, and errors in production.

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**  
   Automatically test and deploy updated models just like software code.

## The MLOps Lifecycle

MLOps turns model development into a repeatable, automated loop:

</p>

1. **Data Ingestion and Validation**
2. **Data Processing**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Model Validation**
5. **Model Deployment**
6. **Model Monitoring**
7. **Feedback & Retraining**

Each stage is automated as much as possible for speed, reproducibility, and quality.

## Example: MLOps in Action

Imagine an e-commerce site that predicts product recommendations:

- Data pipeline ingests new user data daily.
- Model is retrained weekly with latest purchases.
- Model is deployed as an API.
- Monitoring checks if recommendations drop in accuracy.
- When accuracy drops, retraining is triggered automatically.

## Code Example: Deploying a Model with FastAPI

A very simple REST API for a trained model (serving predictions):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')  # Load your trained model

@app.get("/predict")
def predict(size: float, rooms: int):
    X_new = np.array([[size, rooms]])
    pred = model.predict(X_new)
    return {"predicted_price": float(pred[0])}
````

## Best Practices in MLOps

* **Automate as much as possible** (testing, deployment, monitoring)
* **Track everything:** code, data, experiments, model versions
* **Keep code and data versioned together**
* **Use containers** (like Docker) for reproducible deployments
* **Monitor in production** for model accuracy, data drift, and system health
* **Collaborate:** Keep communication open between data science, engineering, and product teams
