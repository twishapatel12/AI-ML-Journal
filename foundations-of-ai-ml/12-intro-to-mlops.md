# Introduction to MLOps

---

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) bridges the gap between developing ML models and deploying them reliably in real-world systems. It blends best practices from **machine learning**, **DevOps**, and **software engineering** to automate, monitor, and manage ML workflows.

Effective MLOps ensures that ML models are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with evolving data and business needs.

---

## What Problems Does MLOps Solve?

- Scaling models from notebooks to production environments
- Versioning of code, data, and models
- Automating pipelines for data, training, and evaluation
- Monitoring models in production for drift, bias, or failure
- Establishing CI/CD for model lifecycle

3. **MLOps Phases (ML + Dev + Ops)**  
   Illustrates how machine learning, development, and operations integrate in ML workflows with tools like Git, CI platforms, and model registries :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

4. **Azure MLOps Deployment Flow**  
   Shows CI (build & test), CD (deploy pipelines), and model-serving steps in Azure’s MLOps architecture :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

These industry-standard visuals reinforce how MLOps streamlines each step—from data to deployment and monitoring.

## Core Components of MLOps

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for code, DVC for datasets and model checkpoints.
2. **Data Pipelines**: Automate ingestion, cleaning, and transformation.
3. **Experiment Tracking**: Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts (e.g. MLflow, Weights & Biases).
4. **Model Registry**: Centralized model versioning and metadata storage.
5. **Deployment**: Package models into REST APIs or serve via containers and platforms (Docker, Flask, Kubernetes, FastAPI).
6. **Monitoring**: Track model metrics, detect drift, manage rollback or retraining.
7. **CI/CD for ML**: Automated testing & deployment of models like software features.

## Example: Minimal Model Serving with FastAPI

```python
# file: serve_model.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load('house_price_model.pkl')

@app.get("/predict")
def predict(size: float, rooms: int):
    features = np.array([[size, rooms]])
    price = model.predict(features)
    return {"predicted_price": float(price[0])}
````

This simple endpoint demonstrates how a trained model can be served and accessed via REST.
