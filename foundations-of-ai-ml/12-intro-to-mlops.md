# Introduction to MLOps

---

## Introduction

Machine Learning Operations (**MLOps**) is the field that helps turn machine learning prototypes into reliable, scalable products.  
MLOps brings together best practices from machine learning, DevOps, and software engineering to automate, monitor, and manage ML systems.

Well-managed MLOps means your models are reproducible, maintainable, and stay accurate even as data or business needs change.

## Why MLOps Matters

- Moves ML models from research to real-world applications
- Automates data and model pipelines for speed and reliability
- Tracks experiments, models, and data for reproducibility
- Enables continuous monitoring and improvement of models
- Supports collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and operations teams

## The MLOps Lifecycle: Industry-Standard Visuals

Below are examples of real MLOps lifecycles and workflows used in production environments:

## Core Components of MLOps

1. **Version Control:** Track code, data, and models (Git, DVC).
2. **Data Pipelines:** Automate ingestion, cleaning, and transformation (Airflow, Prefect).
3. **Experiment Tracking:** Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts (MLflow, Weights & Biases).
4. **Model Registry:** Store and version models centrally.
5. **Deployment:** Serve models via APIs, containers, or cloud platforms (Docker, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving).
6. **Monitoring:** Track performance, drift, and data issues (Prometheus, Grafana).
7. **CI/CD for ML:** Automate testing and deployment for all ML artifacts.

## Example: Minimal Model Serving with FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')  # Pretrained model

@app.get("/predict")
def predict(size: float, rooms: int):
    X = np.array([[size, rooms]])
    pred = model.predict(X)
    return {"predicted_price": float(pred[0])}
````

*A basic REST API for serving predictions from a trained ML model.*

## Best Practices in MLOps

* Automate as much as possible (pipelines, deployment, monitoring)
* Track code, data, and model versions
* Use containers for reproducible environments
* Monitor models in production for drift and errors
* Collaborate across teams (data, engineering, ops)
